### This code was forked from - https://github.com/ndee85/Driver-Constraint-Addon 
- Changed the name to 'Shapekey Driver Creator' to avoid any confusion to blender's constraints.
- Updated to work the blender v3.6.5 +
- Added the option to add Limit Location/Rotation/Scale constraints to the bone, limiting the
  bone's movement to the ones defined for the shapekey. This feature is limited in what it can
  do and may have adverse affects on existing Limit Location/Rotation/Scale constraints. Use with
  caution and double check the results!
